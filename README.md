# For_MolSSI

All code development I have previously done is for proprietary software such as GAMESS (General Atomic and Electronic Structure Software) and EXCESS (EXtreme-scale Electronic Structure System) for quantum chemistry calculations. In this repository I am posting code samples of some of the code I have implemented in both software packages.  

GAMESS is primarily written in Fortran: small sample codes related to my work in GAMESS are omp_gpu_ints.f90 and SPD_0002.f90 source files. 
EXESS is written in C++/CUDA: sample codes include dscheduler.cpp + hgp_kernel_scheduler.h and two example ONEI kernels in one_elec_ints.cu
